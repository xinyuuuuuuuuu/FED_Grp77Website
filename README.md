"Timeless Market" is the name of our website. As the name implies, our website ought to be a place where customers can discover goods that endure in a world that is constantly changing. Nonetheless, things will always pass unnoticed if they are not brought to people's attention, such as the amazing local businesses that provide customers with their amazing products and services. Hence, our website aims to give these local businesses a place for their products to shine and also for consumers to have a look at the unnoticed treasure in Sigapore through our reviews. We display the various local businesses in various categories on our website, including fashion, hobbies, art, thrift stores, food, and jewelry. We will primarily provide reviews of the stores so that users have the opportunity to experience the products through our eyes and reviews. In an effort to be communicative with our users, we offer features like a comment section where users can express their ideas and opinions to us and other users on the website. We also have a page where users can report problems they've encountered with the website or leave recommendations for improvements.


# Design Process
Our goal is for small local businesses in Singapore to be discovered by more people so that they may gain customers and build their reputation. "How do we capture the hearts of the users so that they may be interested in the businesses?" is something we thought a lot about. Eventually, we came to the conclusion that people are most influenced by the reviews and words of others. If we were to give a sincere and genuine review for these local businesses, the users would be able to see it and give these local businesses a chance by trying out their products. With that in mind, we started designing the website. This website is divided into four sections.

First, let's look at the "Home" page. This page provides a quick overview of our website and explains what we can do for users and business owners. Visitors to our website have the option to subscribe in order to receive notifications on the latest reviews from us. After they have subscribed to our website, they may log into their account whenever they want. Business owners also have the option of sending us relevant details about their business so that we can look into it and write a review.

The "specials of the month" page comes next. The top 3 most-viewed reviews of the month will be displayed to users on this page. This makes it possible for new users, particularly those who are unsure of where to begin, to look at the most well-viewed reviews before reading any others.

The next is the "stores" page. The main focus of the website is this page. On this page, users can read reviews of local businesses' products and also share and discuss their opinions with one another. Users can engage in interactive experiences through this, and business owners can gain more insight into what consumers think of their products and improve or modify them accordingly.

The "support" page is the final page. This page's objective is to provide a forum for users to offer suggestions for this website or if there are other local businesses they would like to see us review. They can also report any bugs or issues they discover with the website here.
